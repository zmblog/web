				<h2>Website Abstract</h2>
				<p><strong> This website is essentially a personal page, dedicated to a weekly blog which documents my
				  pursuits this summer; from algebra to real analysis and codeforces to flask and django, I hope to spend my summer
				  learning and improving my skills in a wide range of areas in mathematics and computer science (Yes I am aware I am 20 days into it already).
				  Also this helps me improve my Latex typsetting skills, as well as upload notes on topics such as those mentioned above for... randoms, to use I suppose.
				  I also will aim to provide abstracts for each page as to avoid confusion about the purpose of each page. 
				  <br><br>
				  Note that the formatting and style of this webpage comes from 
				  <a href="https://github.com/vincentdoerig/latex-css">this GitHub link</a>, which I somehow randomly came accross
				  when searching how to convert a pdf not in Latex formatting, well, to Latex formatting lol.
				  It was one of the main reasons I was inspired to do this tbh. If you can't tell already, I like Latex very much.
