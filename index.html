			  <h2>Abstract</h2>
			  <p>This page is essentially random maths stuff I've come across that I find remotely interesting.
				It also helps me improve my Latex typsetting skills and hopefully it is somewhat useful for at least one person.
				If not, which is more likely, doesn't matter; the Latex formatting looks cool anyway lol.
				<br><br>
				Btw the formatting and style of this webpage comes from 
				<a href="https://github.com/vincentdoerig/latex-css">this GitHub link</a>, which I somehow randomly came accross
				when searching how to convert a pdf not in Latex formatting, well, to Latex formatting lol.
				It was one of the main reasons I did this lmao. If you can't tell already, I like Latex very much.
